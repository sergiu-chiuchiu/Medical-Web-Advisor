        <h3 id="Introduction" class="text-info">Introduction</h3>
        <p>
            In the development of the web application we took into consideration multiple aspects such as the user
            interaction and design.
        </p>
        <p>
            Regarding the design we have taken into consideration to have an uniform layout across all of our pages. We
            decided to use a simple yet modern design which consists of smooth surfaces and only a few light colors. We
            preferred to use a combination of white, gray, red and black as backgrounds. Our aim is to provide the users
            a clean and simple design. Since the design is light and easy to get accustomed with, we ensure that it will
            be easy for the visitors to get used with the webiste functionalities, thus increasing the visitor retention
            rate.
        </p>
        <p>
            When it comes of user interaction we followed the KISS principle (Keep It Simple and "Smart"). This way we
            tried to create the premises of an user fiendly environment where the flow of the application would follow
            the logical and intuitive path that a visitor would prefer and use.
        </p>

        <h3 id="Front-End-Technologies" class="text-info">Front End Technologies</h3>
        <p>
            For the development of the interface we decided to use React library for the ability to easily modularize
            the HTML layout into reusable components and Redux for managing the state of the application at a global
            scope.
        </p>
        <p>For this we used Node.js v13 as a react server and the package manger <code>npm</code> v6 that facilitates an
            easy package
            configuration through package.json</p>
        <p>
            Apart from that we used a series of additional packages that helped us in the development of various key
            functionalities:
        </p>
        <ul>
            <li>
                <span class="text-secondary"><code>React-router-dom</code></span>
                <p class="ml-4">With the help of this package we were able design our web application as a single page
                    application. This would benefit especiially the performance of the application since it would no
                    longer be necessary to relaod the entire page when the user switches from one page to another. Only
                    the new assets will be requested form the react server, which in turn will translate to more fluent
                    user navigation on the website.</p>
            </li>
            <li>
                <span class="text-secondary"><code>Font Awesome</code></span>
                <p class="ml-4">This package contains thousands of graphical elements that can be imported into the
                    project, thus eliminating the need of manually creating the graphical content using css. Moreover
                    with the latest version of this module that we are using it is no longer necessary to import into
                    the deployed project all the icons provided. Developers can manually import only those icons that
                    are actuallly used in the project.</p>
            </li>
            <li>
                <span class="text-secondary"><code>Material-UI</code></span>
                <p class="ml-4">It is an UI Framework that provides graphical React components which can then be
                    customized through pre-defined properties. It is similar to react-bootstrap package.</p>
            </li>
            <li>
                <span class="text-secondary"><code>React Styled Components</code></span>
                <p class="ml-4">Provides the means of developing reusable styles which can also receive props, meaning
                    that these components can be designed to be used in various scenarios.</p>
            </li>
            <li>
                <span class="text-secondary"><code>Redux-thunk</code></span>
                <p class="ml-4">Is a middleware which allows us to perform asynchronous request to the server.</p>
            </li>
            <li>
                <span class="text-secondary"><code>axios</code></span>
                <p class="ml-4">Promise based HTTP client that works with React.</p>
            </li>
        </ul>
        <hr>
        <br>
        <h3 id="Back-End-Technologies" class="text-info">Back End Technologies</h3>
        <p>For the Back End implementation our plan is to develop a REST API that would serve data to the client in JSON
            format. To achieve this, we decided to use Python as the main programming language. On top of this, to
            facilitate the development of the REST API we will use the lightweight Flask framework which is growing in
            popularity exactly beacuse of its simplicity and ease of use, comparing to other frameworks such as Django.
        </p>
        <p>For the data persistence layer we intent to use Maria DB which is nothing but a fork of MySQL database server
            now being managed by Oracle.</p>
        <p>Similar to <code>npm</code> we will use <code>pip-env</code> to manage the externally imported librabries.
            <code>pip-env</code> grants us the advantage of combining the popular package manager <code>pip</code> with
            the concept of Python virtual environments which allows developing in parallel multiple projects that use
            different vesions of Python and also different versions of the packages, on the same machine.</p>
        <p>Another useful package that we will use is <code>Flask-SQLAlchemy</code> which is an Object Relational Mapper
            for Python, similar to what Hibernate is being used for in Java. Thanks to this library it is no longer
            necessary to manually create the database tables, since SQLAlchemy will generate it from the classes
            created.</p>

        <h3 id="apis" class="text-info">API's</h3>
        <p>The first web service that we integrated into our application is one for providing images. We opted to use
            <a href="https://source.unsplash.com/" target="_blank"><strong>Unsplash Image API</strong></a> which offers
            a database of over 1.4 million images.</p>
        <ul class="ml-4 text-secondary">
            <li>
                Unsplash service is free to use for low to moderate volume of requests, which makes it ideal for our
                website to retrieve the necessary image from their API, rather than requesting it from our server.
            </li>
            <li>
                It allows us to request random images, yet it is also flexible enough to provide these images from
                specified collections. In our case the medical collection.
            </li>
            <li>
                For the requested image the API provides different query parameters that can be used to compress, crop,
                resize, apply filters (blur etc.), change aspect ratio, such that by the time the image is received, it
                is already properly formatted to be displayed on the webpage.
            </li>
        </ul>
        <p>Another web service that we integrated into the application is a RSS feed that aggregates news from the
            medical field. <a href="https://medisys.newsbrief.eu/medisys/homeedition/en/home.html"
                targe="_blank"><strong>Medisys</strong></a> was used in our app in order to offer the users the
            possibility to directly search for their subject of interest on the RSS feed website.</p>
        <ul class="ml-4 text-secondary">
            <li>
                The feed is based on XML schema, thus in order to parse it into a JavaScript object we used another API
                specialized for RSS feeds.
            </li>
        </ul>
        <p><a href="https://rss2json.com/" target="_blank"><strong>RSS to JSON</strong></a> is an online converter service that converts
            the provided RSS feed as query param and returns it in a JSON format that can be easily saved into a
            JavaScript object.</p>
        <ul class="ml-4 text-secondary">
            <li>
                It is very important that the URL provided as query parameter is already escaped eg.
                <code>https%3A%2F%2Fnews.ycombinator.com%2Frss</code> otherwise the request will not be resolved.
            </li>
        </ul>
