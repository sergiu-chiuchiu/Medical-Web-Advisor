        <h3 id="Introduction" class="text-info">Introduction</h3>
        <p>
            In the development of the web application we took into consideration multiple aspects such as the user
            interaction and design.
        </p>
        <p>
            Regarding the design we have taken into consideration to have an uniform layout across all of our pages. We
            decided to use a simple yet modern design which consists of smooth surfaces and only a few light colors. We
            preferred to use a combination of white, gray, red and black as backgrounds. Our aim is to provide the users
            a clean and simple design. Since the design is light and easy to get accustomed with, we ensure that it will
            be easy for the visitors to get used with the webiste functionalities, thus increasing the visitor retention
            rate.
        </p>
        <p>
            When it comes of user interaction we followed the KISS principle (Keep It Simple and "Smart"). This way we
            tried to create the premises of an user fiendly environment where the flow of the application would follow
            the logical and intuitive path that a visitor would prefer and use.
        </p>

        <h3 id="Front-End-Technologies" class="text-info">Front End Technologies</h3>
        <p>
            For the development of the interface we decided to use React library for the ability to easily modularize
            the HTML layout into reusable components and Redux for managing the state of the application at a global
            scope.
        </p>
        <p>For this we used Node.js v13 as a react server and the package manger <code>npm</code> v6 that facilitates an
            easy package
            configuration through package.json</p>
        <p>
            Apart from that we used a series of additional packages that helped us in the development of various key
            functionalities:
        </p>
        <ul>
            <li>
                <span class="text-secondary"><code>React-router-dom</code></span>
                <p class="ml-4">With the help of this package we were able design our web application as a single page
                    application. This would benefit especiially the performance of the application since it would no
                    longer be necessary to relaod the entire page when the user switches from one page to another. Only
                    the new assets will be requested form the react server, which in turn will translate to more fluent
                    user navigation on the website.</p>
            </li>
            <li>
                <span class="text-secondary"><code>Font Awesome</code></span>
                <p class="ml-4">This package contains thousands of graphical elements that can be imported into the
                    project, thus eliminating the need of manually creating the graphical content using css. Moreover
                    with the latest version of this module that we are using it is no longer necessary to import into
                    the deployed project all the icons provided. Developers can manually import only those icons that
                    are actuallly used in the project.</p>
            </li>
            <li>
                <span class="text-secondary"><code>Material-UI</code></span>
                <p class="ml-4">It is an UI Framework that provides graphical React components which can then be
                    customized through pre-defined properties. It is similar to react-bootstrap package.</p>
            </li>
            <li>
                <span class="text-secondary"><code>React Styled Components</code></span>
                <p class="ml-4">Provides the means of developing reusable styles which can also receive props, meaning
                    that these components can be designed to be used in various scenarios.</p>
            </li>
            <li>
                <span class="text-secondary"><code>Redux-thunk</code></span>
                <p class="ml-4">Is a middleware which allows us to perform asynchronous request to the server.</p>
            </li>
            <li>
                <span class="text-secondary"><code>axios</code></span>
                <p class="ml-4">Promise based HTTP client that works with React.</p>
            </li>
        </ul>

        <h3 id="Back-End-Technologies" class="text-info">Back End Technologies</h3>
        <p>For the Back End implementation our plan is to develop a <strong>REST API</strong> that would serve data to
            the client in JSON
            format. To achieve this, we decided to use Python as the main programming language. On top of this, to
            facilitate the development of the REST API we will use the lightweight <strong><a
                    href="https://www.fullstackpython.com/flask.html">Flask framework</a></strong> which is growing in
            popularity exactly beacuse of its simplicity and ease of use, comparing to other frameworks such as Django.
        </p>
        <p>For the data persistence layer we used PostgreSQL relational database management system. We have deployed the
            PostgreSQL version 10 database on an Amazon Web Services RDS instance. Since we are using the free tier the
            instance has allocated 1Gb of RAM memory and 1vCPU</p>
        <p>Similar to <code>npm</code> we will use <code>pip-env</code> to manage the externally imported librabries.
            <code>pip-env</code> grants us the advantage of combining the popular package manager <code>pip</code> with
            the concept of Python virtual environments which allows developing in parallel multiple projects that use
            different vesions of Python and also different versions of the packages, on the same machine.</p>
        <p>Another useful package that we will use is <code>Flask-SQLAlchemy</code> which is an Object Relational Mapper
            for Python, similar to what Hibernate is being used for in Java. Thanks to this library it is no longer
            necessary to manually create the database tables, since SQLAlchemy will generate it from the classes
            created.</p>

        <h3 id="apis" class="text-info">API's</h3>
        <p>The first web service that we integrated into our application is one for providing images. We opted to use
            <a href="https://source.unsplash.com/" target="_blank"><strong>Unsplash Image API</strong></a> which offers
            a database of over 1.4 million images.</p>
        <ul class="ml-4 text-secondary">
            <li>
                Unsplash service is free to use for low to moderate volume of requests, which makes it ideal for our
                website to retrieve the necessary image from their API, rather than requesting it from our server.
            </li>
            <li>
                It allows us to request random images, yet it is also flexible enough to provide these images from
                specified collections. In our case the medical collection.
            </li>
            <li>
                For the requested image the API provides different query parameters that can be used to compress, crop,
                resize, apply filters (blur etc.), change aspect ratio, such that by the time the image is received, it
                is already properly formatted to be displayed on the webpage.
            </li>
        </ul>
        <p>Another web service that we integrated into the application is a RSS feed that aggregates news from the
            medical field. <a href="https://medisys.newsbrief.eu/medisys/homeedition/en/home.html"
                targe="_blank"><strong>Medisys</strong></a> was used in our app in order to offer the users the
            possibility to directly search for their subject of interest on the RSS feed website.</p>
        <ul class="ml-4 text-secondary">
            <li>
                The feed is based on XML schema, thus in order to parse it into a JavaScript object we used another API
                specialized for RSS feeds.
            </li>
        </ul>
        <p><a href="https://rss2json.com/" target="_blank"><strong>RSS to JSON</strong></a> is an online converter
            service that converts
            the provided RSS feed as query param and returns the data in a JSON format that can be easily saved into a
            JavaScript object.</p>
        <ul class="ml-4 text-secondary">
            <li>
                It is very important that the URL provided as query parameter is already escaped eg.
                <code>https%3A%2F%2Fnews.ycombinator.com%2Frss</code> otherwise the request will not be resolved.
            </li>
        </ul>

        <h3 id="uiDesign" class="text-info">User interaction and design</h3>
        <p>The web application we propose consists of multiple modules that we will describe more in depth below.</p>
        <br>
        <h5 id="authentication" class="text-info">Authentication</h5>
        <img src="assets/register.png" class="img-fluid" alt="Register page">
        <br>
        <br>
        <p>For authentication we decided to use a modal for both registration and login features. This way the user is
            not required to leave the current page he is visiting.</p>
        <p>We tried to keep the registration form as light as possible, so the required fields are username, name, email
            and password. Among these we decided to leave the name field as an optional input.</p>
        <p>In addition, we intend to provide a profile page where the user can change specific informations about him
            change his password etc.</p>


        <br>
        <h5 id="home-page" class="text-info">Home page</h5>
        <img src="assets/homePage.png" class="img-fluid" alt="">
        <br>
        <br>
        <p>The home page contains a list with the recommended featured news in the medical domain. Moreover the page
            also features a sidebar that displays the latest news.</p>
        <p>We also intend to add tagging to each news page so that the user can receive more personalized content based
            on the matching between his interest and the content available.</p>
        <h6>The services/technologies used on this page in particular are:</h6>
        <ul class="ml-4 text-secondary">
            <li>
                Unsplash API: for requesting the desired images corresponding to the article.
            </li>
            <li>Material-UI: for designing the layout of the page, grid model, etc.</li>
        </ul>
        <p>Furthermore the news displayed also have a rating option, meaning that the visitors can quickly see the
            quality of the article and they can themselves rate the article.</p>
        <br>
        <h5 id="news-page" class="text-info">News page</h5>
        <p>From the news list a visitor can then easily access the news page and read the entire article. We provide
            additional informations such as publication date, author and tags.</p>
        <p>The article is structured such that the first thing the reader will see is a featured article related to that
            topic. Under that 2 more smaller cards are displayed that link as well to other related articles.</p>
        <p>We also intend in the future to provide the facility for readers to view and leave comments. Moreover, we
            intend to implement a feature that will allow the users to receive email alerts when a new comment has been
            published.</p>
        <p>The rating functionality is also present at the top of the article.</p>

        <br>
        <h5 id="rss-feed" class="text-info">Search in external RSS Feed</h5>
        <p>On this page we offer the possibility to the users to search outside the boudaries of our website the medical
            informations they need. A visitor that is interested in a specific topic can access this feature and search
            for information using the rss feed aggregator <a
                href="https://medisys.newsbrief.eu/medisys/homeedition/en/home.html"
                targe="_blank"><strong>Medisys</strong></a>, that we use in our implementation to retrieve the desired
            data.</p>
        <p>After the information is retrieved from the rss service, we display it on the page in a listed order,
            where we provide various informations such as the article title, a short description, related tags adn
            publication date.</p>
        <br>
        <h5 id="medical-staff" class="text-info">Medical Staff</h5>
        <p>On this page the visitors can find medical specialists in various fields of expertise. they can also filter
            them by city of residence.</p>
        <p>Moreover, we intend to also provide the work location of the specialists and display on a map where they are
            each situated compared to the current location of the user.</p>
        <p>Functionalities such as add to favorite and rating will also be available, as well as reviews from their
            former patients.</p>
